This is just how I chose to track the version of a closed source Python app I made for deciding when to show a notification about a potential update for the app.

I'm not sure if I will make it open source. It kind of has flaws... I probably won't make another python desktop app. py2exe was a nightmare, and I made a pretty complex python script to generate MIDI chords for a school project (which will be proprietary after I switch that to C++), and that took 20+ minutes to run. There was some other stuff happening in the script that was completely unnecessary (I didn't have any say in it because it was a group project), but I suspect that it will run instantly in a JUCE (C++) audio plugin.

TL;DR: Python is slow and not very cool, unless we're using Google Colab or Django... but even then, it would probably be cheaper to go "serverless" for a web app, if applicable.
